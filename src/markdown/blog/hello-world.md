Hello, people of the Internet.

This post will serve as a short introduction about me and this blog.

# About Me
My name is Vedran Blazenka and I’m very passionate and dedicated Front-End developer from Croatia.

I’m working at [reactor.studio](http://reactor.studio/) as JavaScript Developer where I work on [IvySpace](http://ivyspace.com/).
Before Reactor Studio I worked at [Enterwell](https://enterwell.net/) where I did a lot of cool projects using WordPress, React and Redux.

I’m very passionate about web technologies, especially JavaScript ecosystem that is growing day by day and has a great and helpful community built around itself.

My current tech stack is Node, React, Redux, Webpack, Jest and I’m currently learning more about [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/)

I love experimenting with new technologies and I spend most of my days when I’m not working playing around with new languages and libraries. Most of it I publish on my [GitHub](https://github.com/wedranb).

Aside from programming, I love watching TV shows, play chess, cruise on my skateboard, learn German, teach people JavaScript and drink beers with friends and listen to podcasts and audio books.

# About Blog
This blog started because I wanted to pursue writing as my new skill and because I wanted to share my learning processes with my dear followers.

I will mostly write about JavaScript, Computer Science and Web technologies that I’m currently pursuing like MobX, TypeScript, Flow, PWA, Service Workers, SSR, etc…

I hope you like this short introduction about me and this blog.
